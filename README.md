# My Tea Project

## Description

My Tea Project is an open-source initiative dedicated to the creation of an innovative application that leverages the TEA (Tokenized Ecosystem for Applications) protocol. The main objective is to provide developers and users with an intuitive interface for interacting with the TEA protocol, facilitating the creation and management of tokenized ecosystems.

## Objectives

- **Simplify the adoption of the TEA protocol**: Provide tools and resources that make the integration of the TEA protocol accessible even to those with little experience in the blockchain sector.
- **Promote innovation**: Create an environment that stimulates the development of decentralized applications (dApp) using the TEA protocol.
- **Support the community**: Build an active support network where users can share knowledge, resources and collaborate on common projects.
